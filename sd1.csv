"hello, how can I help you "
yeah I want t- I want to determine the maximum number of boxcars of oranges that I can get to Bath by seven a.m. tomorrow morning so... hm... so I guess all the boxcars will have to go through oran- through Corning because that's where the orange juice... orange factory is... so from Corning to Bath how far is that 
two hours
and it's gonna take us also an hour to load boxcars right 
right 
okay... so... umm so... every trip will take at least three hours then 
right we can unload any amount of cargo onto a train in one hour so we can do a maximum of three boxcars in an hour 
right... okay... okay so I guess one thing we can do... oh... so I guess one thing is that we should see how many boxcars we can actually get to Corning in four hours 
"okay so that's three boxcars, engine E one from Avon going to Dansville, pick up the three boxcars, go to Corning load them up and then take it to Bath"
that's right 
"okay so that's good, so then I guess we can also take like engine E two with those two boxcars from Elmira take it to Corning, so Elmira to Corning is two hours"
mm-hm
okay and okay so yeah that that should also work  
mm-hm
so le- so did you wanna repeat that plan 
"okay engine E one goes to Dansville picks up three boxcars goes to Corning, is loaded with oranges and goes to Bath; engine E two picks the two boxcars at Elmira to Corning where they're loaded with oranges and then takes them to Bath "
okay so that gives us a maximum number of five boxcars... Okay
