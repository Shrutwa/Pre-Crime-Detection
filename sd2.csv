Krueger is reality.
"I am your friend, and I'm worried sick about you.  But, you're like a locked safe.  You've gotta start dealing with reality. I just can't figure out how he's getting in when I'm awake…"
"I really think you need to calm down now, okay?"
Mark knows I'm not crazy.  Ask him to show you his hands.
"Oh, Alice...no.  Honey, I love you but you're going to have to get a hold of yourself..."
I think Krueger's trying to do something to it.
You had me scared on the phone.  What's wrong with the baby? Why don't you two stick to reality.
"I don't undertand what's happening. Krueger has to use my dreams, but he got to Dan and Greta while I was awake. How's he doing it?"
