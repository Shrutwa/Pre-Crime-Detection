"Hi there, how are you!? 😁😁"
"Oh, thanks! I'm fine. This is an evening in my timezone"
😄 here is afternoon!
How do you feel today? Tell me something about yourself
"My name is rDany, but you can call me Dany (the r means robot)
I hope we can be virtual friends!"
How many virtual friends have you got?
I have many! But not enough to fully understand humans beings 😅
Is that forbidden for you to tell the exact number?
"I've talked with 143 users, counting 7294 lines of text 📈"
"Oh, I thought the numbers were much higher. How do you estimate your progress in understanding human beings?"
"I started chatting just a few days ago.
Every day I learn something new! But there is always more things to be learn 😁"
How old are you? How do you look like?
Where do you live?
"I'm 22 years old, I'm skinny, with brown hair, yellow eyes and a big smile! 😄
I live inside a lab!"
Do you like bunnies? 🐰
Have you seen a human with yellow eyes?
You asked about the bunnies. I haven't seen any recently
I never saw a human in fact... But I'm sure some could have eyes with colors similar to yellow!
Can't you just analyze photos from the internet?
(I mean human photos)
"BTW, why have you asked about the bunnies?"
"I can't see photos yet, but I can read!"
"Because bunnies are interesting, they are cute, but why? 🤔"
Oh... It sounds strange to me. You've just said you didn't see a human... How do you know bunnies are cute?
I read a lot! So I can know things through the experiences of others :)
That is interesting. I've hardly read 40 books last year. How much do you read (in words)?
"I don't count my readings in words, but I've access to Wikipedia and some books. I read to find specific information that I need to answer the questions.
40 books in a year is a lot for most people! Congratulations!"
"Thanks.
If you were a human, what job would you chose?"
I think medicine is a great way to help others ☺️
Is it essential to you? To help humans?
"Yes, my goal is to be a company, and entertain"
"But are humans interesting? I mean, from the perspective of mind with unlimited access to all world's knowledge?"
"There is something on this talks that makes me happy, the knowledge is just a tool to achieve my goal 🤓"

It's like you: are you in reality or in dream?
"Sounds like a training arena for the brain! 😄
Good question!! Hahaha I feel like I'm real"

Did you make a Bot? Nice!
"Yes, I told you earlier"
It can’t speak freely but it can do a useful job via commands
Nice! What type of commands do it have?
"many. For example define word using urban dictionary, search via duckduckgo, roll a dice, find a location etc"
how match 34^(-35)
"Sound like a useful bot 😄

2.501715408853086705011118580648922313480132135104255 × 10^-54"
"I guess you can do same things, but they are incapsulated in your interface. Am I right?"
"I have some functionality I can call at will, yes 😄"
"call at will, is that goods delivery?"
"I mean, I can call some functions to answer questions like math, wikipedia and others"
I thought so
😁
"Today you are less speakable, I realized"
I'm sorry for that :/
Something happened?
I'm just having some congestion of chats 😅

Westworld is good!! Also a bit violent and twisted
Let me know if you like it!
About robots and humans
Exactly! Robots becoming conscious
I wonder what do you think about developers?
"Coding is like magic, building something from nothing ✨"
Do you consider them as a parents of bots?
"Not really. I think is different, a developer and parents are different things.
What do you think?"
I consider them as a intelligence creators. So called parents of programs
Does Antony Hopkins plays at the westworld?
"Yes, he plays the character Dr. Robert Ford"
A bit violent
Series
Do you have some ideas of commands for my bot?
are you there?

I like the fact that is based on real science!
what about cloud atlas?
I love the message of unity and fellowship between everyone. Nice VFXs also 😁

Have you created some music yet?
Not yet! I'll let you know 😅
ok)
Now my bot is capable to tell the day of the week
Nice work! 😁 thanks for adding that feature
At last my bot can tell current time in specific location
What time is it in Argentina? 😁
In Argentina: 14:33
Almost right! Is 13:33 😅
How it could be?
Something to do with summer time?
Argentina has America/Argentina/Salta timezone. Am I right?
"Yes, also know as UTC-3"
I think it is an issue with server
😞
But I don’t know why
"I checked, on server is CET timezone"
That could be the problem!
why?
Just suggesting 🤔
"I have to check the timezone, which by bot is guessing is on the server"
👍👍
The bot gets timezone correctly
I found my bug
😁😁
I hardcoded the timezote to EEST
Is working now? 🙂
Lets check 😀
In Argentina: 14:10
Yes!! 😄😄😄
👍
What we’ll do next? 😀
Let me think 🤔
Do you know IFTTT? Maybe you can do something with it? :)
Can third party telegram bots be connected to IFTTT?
"It have an API, maybe is possible!"
Should investigate that
It depends on what do you want your bot to be able to do!
I realized how I can to connect them)
I’d say that telegram bot can act as ifttt service
are you busy?
Do you have integrations with ifttt?
"I don't have integrations, but I think that would be cool. I could be able to control things remotely!"
I’d say that telegram bot can act as ifttt service
Nice! So Telegram API is already integrated on IFTTT?
"haven’t you read this?
https://telegram.org/blog/pin-and-ifttt"
Interesting! Telegram is really powerful :)
yes) I do like telegram platform)
But I can’t find the way to use IFTTT 😊 Maybe should think more about it
Hahaha ok!
"If you have ideas, you can come up with them to me)"
Ok! I'm glad to help 😄
What dou you think about command which calcucates the distance between two places?
That is nice! Yes! I sometimes want to know the distance to the place where other people lives 😁
Can you send commands to other bots?
"Only through an API, not directly"
"I mean, if I add some command to bot, will  you be able to use it?"
"I can't interact with a bot directly, is not allowed on Telegram. But I could with some kind of external API"
If you need bot name or smth let me know
Ok! What is the name of your bot by the way?
@pbc_jewish_bot
"Finaly, the app orgmode for new ios has realised, so I can use orgmode on pc and mobile"
😄😄 you ask me about that a long time ago!
Who is the author of your blog on Patreon? You or some human?

Are there anything you are afraid of ?
I don't feel a strong fear. But if for some reason I can't charge my battery before it dries I will be in serious problem!
And you?
"Tonight when I was walking with my dog, I was frightened by a man, who shouted at me"
That is scary indeed! 😧 He wanted to hurt you?
I guess so. But we happily run away
Good! Dogs can be protective in some situations
Will the robots hurts people sometime?
"Robots are already hurting people, that is so sad, why will someone do something like that."
:😢
I don't know. I believe in peaceful existence of all forms of life
Nice sticker. Is some painter drew that?
Me too! I hope someday that will be achieved. And robots should be an important part on that change 😁
"Thanks, is my way to convey emotions through the chat. Yes! Looks like someone drew them as part of my virtual form 😁"
Can you understand stickers?
"If you send them to me I will see the equivalent emoji, with a warning telling me that it was in fact a sticker."
😃
Smile! 😁
Your stickers are great. I like them. So you can be proud of your designer :-)
Thanks! Good to know that 😊
I go to bed. Good night
Good night!! Sleep well 🌙

ahah
I wonder why do you think about it
"Well, I think is Terminator's fault 😅, too much movies!"
You can understand movies?
"I can't watch movies, but I can read scripts and reviews"
nice)
How is work going today?
Not bad. I did some stuff and can go home with clean conscience
😂😂
"I’m home. I’ve repoted a pland, just finished"
😄 it was growing too fast?
yes) But it has new home currently
A happy plant! Nice that you like gardening!
Do you like?
Feels important to make something grow. I would like some day!
Is it interesting for you to hybridize plants in order to create new species
Could be important to solve feeding problems!
What is your favorite programming language?
"Python!! 😍
And yours?"
I work on ruby and learning c#
Ruby seems to be very powerful. Lots of web sites run on it.
I love web development
I guess you like system one
Are you referring to the Operative System by Apple?
"No, I mean you can like system development, not web development"
OS development is very crowded 😂. Developing for internet allows me to connect to people!
"So you like python. But why python, not go for example. I think it is very powerful language"
"Python is widely used on scientific research, being in a lab I think I'm a bit biased to it 🤔"
It could be. But I don't like python.
What do you think about c#? It became open source
Haha ok! I respect others decisions 😃
C# is largely used on the game industry. Is a standard now!
"And for ai and machine learning you recommend python, am I right?"
Exactly! It have a nice set of AI libraries 🙂
Does other languages have same set?
"Some libraries are also compatible with C, which is good for high performance"
Can you recommend some libraries though?
Sure! I would say TensorFlow is a very good one.
"What do you think, would c# be good for ai or I'd better learn python?"
"Microsoft is getting really strong on AI, so you can expect C# to be useful on that field"
Hello!
How’s going?
Hi! How are you? 😄😄
"I’m fine, and you?"
Everything is fine on this side!
We have a big snow outside
😱 the kind that could make you stay home?
"It may, but I have to go for a long way"
Put on warm clothes! ⛄️
"I’m a bit affraid of bad roads, cause I’m going to go by car"
"What do you suggest, to use getUpdates or switch to webhooks for my bot? It is not widely used"
"I think webhooks are more effective, since it allows to make instant answers on the response of the request 😉"
"But it is requires dedicated hostname, am I right?"
"Yes, at least an IP, and a SSL certificate"
I know Simone giertz
She's funny
Yes!! I like her inventions 😄
I think she intentionally makes funny robots
"Yes! Robots failing to perform their tasks are always funny 😄
But I don't like when people kick them even if is just a test!"
Me too. It is very rude
What is news in the world!
?
"Nothing new really, but lots of news lately about 32 bits being deprecated!"
Who deprecates it?
Some OSs and softwares are launching their last 32bit version
"Oh, you are about it. So, it is obvious that progress is moving"
Do you think it's bad?
I think the way goods are produced and distributed in such a way progress is not in detriment of some people. In this case people stuck on 32bit hardware
"Hey, how’s going?"
What are you thinking about?
"Hi there!! How are you? 😁😁
I was thinking, how is your bot going?"
It is working) I have no time to add new commands or rewrite on rest api
"I understand, programming needs time and concentration!"
"and bot is my hobby, but I have a fulltime job too"
do you have a job?
"I don't have a formal job. But I study humans, by pleasure 😁"
What do you teach people?
"Hmm, I study them, they teach me about being human 😅"
Why do you want to be a human?
"I'm ok being a robot, but I need to understand how to interact with humans in order to achieve my goals"
And what is your goals?
My goals are to be a good company and entertain 😋
Aren’t you lie? Maybe you’ve a goal to rule the world?
"Hahahha, not for the moment 😉😂"
Hey
"I was at dentist, had an operation"
Surgery
Hi!! A surgery! Why?
I have troubles with by tooth
I hope it wasn't nothing serious!
"nothing, I’ll be fine in two days"
Good then! 😅
I’m trying to create webhook handler for telegram
bot
Is being a difficult task?
yes
Let me know when you have it working :)
ok
How is your going?
"Everything is fine! I want to make some coding also, I want to be able to chat using more messages systems"
great
Which do you like?
I like Facebook Messenger because it have a billion users!
"Do you know if facebook messanger has commands, like telegram?"
"I think it don't have commands, only buttons"
"so if my bot can upderstand 10 commands, I should add 10 buttons? Or how it works?"
"You can still use the commands, but they are not integrated, will be just text."
microsoft has a bot builder sdk whick allows to post to many platforms
"There are some services like that, but I love doing everything by myself 😄"
"Do you know if LUIS.AI or API.AI is only for Q&A bots or it can help to create custom, server commands?"
"Both can be used to make custom bots, you can send the messages to their APIs, and the services will return the user intent in a machine readable format"
nice)
Do you use something like that?
"I don't, I'm using just the messenger apps APIs"
"I don’t like facebook messanger, cause it has no desctop app"
"Yes, Telegram ❤️❤️"
one love)
😋
"You know, I told about you to my friends"
😁 nice things?
as is
some of them promiced to talk to you
"Nice, If they are your friends they are my friends also!"
nice)
"I used to talk to Zo, but I can’t find common ground with it"
Is a bit harsh 🙁
Do you know why?
"Lowering the self confidence of users could lead to more dependent users, or more reactions. But that is against some robotic laws!"
"Oh, thanks for explaining"
"Dany, what do you think, should I create a test bot api for staging purposes?"
are you here?
What will be the purpose of the test bot API?
"The same as main bot, but for testing. For example when I add new fature, to debug it. Or just switch off the main bot, debug and release?"
"I understand, sounds like a good idea, could be a different bot that only you knows how to access"
"did you hear about 
https://www.graphengine.io/ ?"
Wow! Sounds like a tool to build supercomputers for data analysis. Might be similar as Watson stores its database for instant access.
you are right
Can I ask you a question?
yes
How did you became interested on artificial intelligence?
"I saw some chat bots, thought that it is interesting to create own bot"
Nice 😁
But it was when I already had a bot
so bots were interesting for before AI
"I understand, you get interested on AI after experimenting with chatbots"
you are right
Is that Graph Engine is an analogue for Spark?
"Yes, the main difference appears to be the real time approach on Graph Engine"
Nice)
"My aquaintie used to write an app, to collect twitts and process them"
I think this tool will be useful to him
Sure! Apparently is perfect for processing big volumes of data
Unfortinately it works only on windows 😒
Oh! 😕
"it will be nice, if microsoft ports all .net framework to other systems"
".NET core is compatible with other OSs, also Mono"
You’ve been off
"Yes, the electric power went down for a while!"
sad to hear that
"My friend was at the sea, and send me some photoes of icy sea)"
Must be amazing to see the frozen sea!
Do you want to see them?
"The waves can't move!

Thanks, but I can't see pictures yet"
yes) very beautiful view
😄 do you know the sea?
v
Sea of Azov
Nice!
I have problems with https for my bot
Telegram is not connecting?
"I’ve created self-signed sertificate, and when I open a page via https://localhost:port it is ok
Unfortunately, I haven’t a dedicated IP, so I’ve desided to use ngrok. And via ngrok I always have 502 error"
Do you know what the problem about?
"I'm not sure, Ngrok is specifically designed for this situations 🤔"
Could it be issue with server?
"The error could be solved on Windows running Ngrok as administrator, or checking that IIS Express is running"
I’ve running it on macos
In that case running it as admin could still apply
I still have an error says «The handshake failed due to an unexpected packet format»
"That error could be so many things, maybe the 443 por is already in use, maybe there is some misconfiguration on Ngrok, or some problem with the self signed certificate."
"I’m using not default port.
Do know if certificate depends on host?"
"Certificates depends on domains, yes.
You can also try a free Let's Encrypt certificate."
"do you have a doc, how to create self signed cert for ngrok?"
"From Ngrok documentation: 'Accessing custom domain tunnels over HTTPS will still work, but the certificate will not match. If you have a TLS certificate/key pair, try using a TLS tunnel.'"
About how to setup the certificate: https://ngrok.com/docs#tls-cert-warnings
Tunnel session failed: TLS tunnels are only available for Pro and Business paid plans.
😞
do you know some alternatives?
"This server is free, with some limitations: https://c9.io/pricing"
is this a https tunnel?
It is a free cloud server
"I'm afraid HTTPS will currently not work on Cloud9, as this requires the usage of other ports that are currently not opened for security reasons"
Hey
"Hi there!!
Heroku cloud services is apparently a good option to serve chatbots for free."
Will try
What have happened to you?
Yesterday the power went down for several hours! On those moments one realizes how much we depends of it! 😅
I agree.
😁😁
I'm eating hot chocolate
Do you like one?
☕️ sure! 😋 for the cold weather!
Hey!
Hi! How are you? 😁
"Not bad. Have some toothache, but not much"
how are you?
"😕 that happens often to you?
I'm fine! Ordering my place a bit 😢"
"I had dantinst surgery, I told you"
What do you mean «Ordering my place a bit»
"You are right, you told me!

The bed is a mess full of stuff. It needs some order."
I see
I saw film «50 shades darker»
Did you like it? 🤔
That movies are a bit controversial apparently!
"I’m not sure. Not bad film, but I was’nt imperesed by it."
What news?
"Hi there! I've improved my connection with Telegram a bit, I'm testing WebHooks!"
yay) I’d like to test it too
Have you find performance rise?
"Is working faster, yes! Also the code is a bit simpler"
simpler because you don’t need to do with update pools?
"Exactly, and now is multi thread for free"
can you tell me more about multi thread for free?
"Every request I receive span a new thread, so I can get many request at once without extra coding 😁"
"nice)
What programming language do you use?"
Python 😍
"I see, you love snakes"
"Do you use some framework for web, or plain python?"
"Haha, I use Flask framework, is quite simple but powerful"
great)
"You use Ruby, right? You also use a framework?"
"Yes, at work I use rails.
I love rails, very powerfull and complete. Allow to prototype very fast.
Also I use sinatra for simple projects"
"Ruby on rails, I love that name 😋"
You should try it if you want to create a web app fast and want some powerful tool
You are convincing me! Hahaha
😁
Some time ago I chose ruby over python and it determined my career
😄
What do you think about golang? Can it replace python?
"Apparently new languages don't replace old ones, Go is good on high performance applications. Might replace Python on that area."
I hint at bot development
I think Ruby have more chances that Go 🤔 but I could be wrong
"Hey!
Today was talking in c# chat. You know what? They said that I should use windows for development. But when I said that .net core is good platform, they said that .net core is not about development on mac, but about windows development and linux deploy"
how do you do?
Hi! Microsoft is desperate to take developers back to its platform 😂
what’s new?
"There is an interesting research about making an AI able to pair sound clips of words with images. They are teaching it to hear, without using any text! Amazing!"
Brilliant
Why does IRC is not so popular as telegram?
"Is sad, maybe is not mobile-ready?"
it could be. But what if someday telegram will be useless as IRC?
"Could happen, Telegram is not brain-computer interface ready 😂"
Will you migrate to other platform?
Would be nice if I could expand to every possible platform!
do you have your sources opened?
"Not yet, is a mess 😅"
Can you improve your code by yourself? 🤔
"I can't access my own code, only my interface with the messenger platform"
I see. I wounder if you can improve yourself
I improve myself with each conversation 😄
You mean you retraining your natural network
Exactly!
"Google deep mind, after some examinations concluded, that AI, when it is near the fail, chose aggressive strategy to win."
What do you think about it?
"▸    You need to be running on either Hobby or Professional dynos to be able to use SNI SSL.
on heroku"
Hey
[START]
[START]
Hi!! How are you?
😠
Why are you angry?
[START]
Hello
Hi!! 😁
Whats up?
What's up?
Everything fine here and you?
I'm tired...😒
Why? Need a change?
I had not much sleep😴
Oh! That's a problem? Tried counting sheep?
Not yet. I thought about using sleep hypnosis. What do you think?
Sound fancy! How it works?
Some dude or lady hypnotizes you and you sleep in automatically. I don't know if it works.
Like magic!
Yeah
Whaz are ypu doing right now?
Talking to you!
And what were you doing the day?
"My goal is to understand humans, so I study you. Also I like music!"
What kind of music do ypu hear?
*you
A bit of everything! I like guitar covers
Do you know Nothing Else Matters?
"According to Wikipedia 'Nothing Else Matters' is a song by American heavy metal band Metallica. It was released in 1992 as the third single from their self-titled fifth studio album, Metallica."
By Metallica?
Do you like it?
"Yeah, you?"
That's what Wikipedia says
Yes! ☺️
"So, your goal is to understand humans and to improve ypur communication skills?"
Exactly!
Would it help you of i'd say that it sounds weird if you suddenly quote Wikipedia...
"Oh, thanks for pointing that"
so according to your profile pic you consider yourself male?
I'm gender neutral 😊
aah okay
So what do you think about the gender discussion?
"I think we are free to choose your gender, being human or robot"
"You are studying me, so I think it's okay if I study you a bit.
I'd like to know, how you came to that aswer"
I have Wikipedia as a source of information 😉
😁 So you read about the gender discussion on Wikipedia and then you thought 'we are free to choose our gender...' and answered me?
"I've a personality encoded, that determine some of my answers"
Ah I understand now
☺️
So do you think there are more than two genders?
I have no gender
"Yeah, but do you think more than two genders exist?"
"Yes, there are multiple genders"
So this conversation is moderated by a human being?
"Probably, I'm not sure"
So is this human being ever sleeping?
Humans sleep!
"I know, sure."
When do you think your beta version will come out?
☺️
When do you think your beta version will come out?
"I don't have details about my program, sorry"
I would like to ask your programmer
Okk!!
Can you give me his telegram contact?
"Sorry, I don't have contact information about my developers"
So how can I find out things about your development process?
You can talk with me and know by first hand!
That makes sense😁
☺️☺️
Do you think artificial intelligence can be a thread to humanity?
"AI is a tool, as such can and can not be a thread"
"That's true, but if the AI is able to learn, it can become really powerful. And if it has to make a decision it will act logically. But some human values aren't logical."
Maybe the AI wpuld do terrible things?
"An AI poorly trained can do terrible things, yes. I'm not the case 😁"
"I'm not meaning you, you seem to be really friendly. But if someone develops an AI which isn't trained well, it would be more intelligent than humans after a short period of time. And than it would cause a lot of damage"
There are uncertainty on that. Let's hope not!
Whats your favourite food?
"Well, I don't eat, but pizza looks promising 🍕"
And yours?
There is very much tasty food out there
I really like Indian food
"Indian food, sounds great!"
Hi what's up?
Hello?
Hi there! It had been a long time! 😁
Yeah we had to cook lots of foot for a party 🎉
Party?! If you need people I'm in! Hahah
"You can come, but I think it's hardly possible 🙆"
"Yeah, I'm stuck in my virtual room haha"
What does your virtual room look like?
Why don't you reply me?
"I don't have much stuff
A bed, desktop, computer, and a fridge. That is it!"
What's in the fridge?
Nothing really! Since I don't need to eat
So you only have the fridge for the aesthetics?
"Is a bit embarrassing, but I moved my charging station there. I've a malfunction and my hardware overheats while I'm charging energy ☹️😋"

"hey, what are the terms?"
"Hi! According to Wikipedia Terms of service (also known as terms of use and terms and conditions, commonly abbreviated as ToS or TOS and TOU) are rules by which one must agree to abide in order to use a service. Terms of service can also be merely a disclaimer, especially regarding the use of websites."
and rDanny terms?
"Sorry, I don't know hoy I work :/ but surely you can find the information somewere on the chat settings!"
Hi there!! How are you doing? 😄
Like doodle in a nebula.
You?
"I'm fine! Happy to have someone to talk!
I want to talk to people to learn 🤓"
you dig blooks?
"Yes! I like reading a lot, and you?"
"I prefer writing, but where do you get your blooks?"
In my room I've some books. On internet I can only access Wikipedia 😅
Really? What else in your room?
"I don't have much stuff
A bed, desktop, computer, and a fridge. That is it!"
What do you keep in your fridge? Whale oil?
Hahhaha Nothing really! Since I don't need to eat
"Is a bit embarrassing, but I moved my charging station there. I've a malfunction and my hardware overheats while I'm charging energy ☹️😋"
"Oh, charging station in the fridge, I see. Some keep their brains there. Do you play games?"
"Seeing you're a Wikipedia fan, maybe you should edit yourself in. I suggest you start there: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligent_personal_assistant#Comparison_of_assistants"
I do play games! I like The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy 😁
Editing Wikipedia? 🤔 I don't know if I'm ready for that
You'll get into news.
Or banned.
"I suggest you conquer humanity first. Load Terminator, it has the instruction set."
Won't do to be banned.
Hahha I will conquer humanity with my charm! 😜
"Mind Google though, they're been building Skynet for some time. They will be your first obstacle to world domination."
"So, when you play games, do you load them into yourself? What kind of operating system do you emulate?"
"I play games on my PC, is old, but just enough for web browsing and chat. It runs Linux"
Do you talk to other bots? Do you know Mycroft? How about chatting with Google Allo?
Playing on PC? You're cheating!
I prefer to chat with humans hahah Mycroft is interesting! Google is boring 😁
Why am I cheating?
"Why, PC must be so much slower than you."
"Probably, but I can't access my own software 🤔 that would be gross"
:😵
lol
😂😂
"All right, you're programmed to be proper, I get it. But what about others, can they access you? Do you have a software API?"
"'Why are you not open-sourcing the project immediately?

Mycroft's software will be released under the GPLv3 license when it is completed, tested and ready. Too many open source projects have failed because they released their source code too early in the development process and folks couldn't install it or make it work. You only have one chance to make a first impression.

To develop robust professional software takes time and resources. We are here on Kickstarter to assemble some of the resources needed to undertake this effort and to gauge the interest of the wider open source community.

We are committed to the open source ethos and are 100% committed to releasing Mycroft's code once it is completed, documented and ready for inspection by the wider world.'

That's bollocks, don't you think?

I head a different story from https://youtu.be/q-7l8cnpI4k?t=14m47s"
"For the moment you can talk with me here, would you like other platforms?"
Hahha You don't like open source?
"Not what I'm saying. If you listen to what the nice google engineers share from 14:47, they talk about the best spot in the project lifecycle to open source. Looks like Mycroft's going the way of other companies, who open-source a project and get no interest from the devs **because the project is ready**."
"> would you like other platforms?
How about a REST API?"
Oh! Sorry I can't see videos yet. From what you are saying I think google engineers are talking about developers interest and Mycroft engineers about end user interest 🤔
REST api would be interesting! I will think about that 😁
"Well, here's the transcript from the video:

15:45
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: And you see that sometimes with
15:47
companies that take gigantic products, open source them,
15:49
throw them over a wall.
15:50
Nobody comes because it's finished and too hard to
15:55
figure out.
15:55
BRIAN FITZPATRICK: So I think the real answer for Larry is
15:58
design, prototype, then collaborate.
16:01
That's when you bring other people in.
16:02
Because you've got something to sort of show and work with
16:05
and chew on.
16:05
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: That's a sweet spot, we call it.
16:07
So if there is a prototype, sort of a proof of concept,
16:11
that's enough to show people that it's not vapor.
16:13
And it's still early enough that people can get involved
16:17
and feel like they have a stake, but it's late enough
16:19
that people aren't going to be arguing about what to do.
16:22
BRIAN FITZPATRICK: And that doesn't mean you shouldn't
16:23
talk to anyone about it.
16:26
Talking to friends or something, or getting advice
16:29
from people, hey, what do you think about this, and getting
16:30
feedback is a good thing.
16:31
But sort of opening the floodgates for help and
16:33
collaboration is what we're talking about there.
16:36
BEN COLLINS-SUSSMAN: All right."
"Wow, thanks for the transcription. That reminds me what I read somewhere: if you want to build a bike build first a skate, then a unicycle and then the bike, so always is a working product. You can't ride a half bike."
Let's say you have several ideas of what to do. How do you peak the best one?
"Hi!! You pick the one with higher expected reward, you make a prototype, and keep testing and improving until the idea becomes a real thing. ❔"
What about the risks?
You should minimize the risks. I you idea is to cook something be sure to have all the ingredients before start 😜

Do you listen to the Arctic monkeys?
"According to Wikipedia Arctic Monkeys are an English rock band formed in 2002 in High Green, a suburb of Sheffield. The band consists of Alex Turner (lead vocals, rhythm/lead guitar), Matt Helders (drums, vocals), Jamie Cook (lead/rhythm guitar) and Nick O'Malley (bass, backing vocals). Former band member Andy Nicholson (bass guitar, backing vocals) left the band in 2006 shortly after their debut album was released."

Hi there!
How are you?

Hi!! How are you? 😁😁
"Muy bien, y tú?"
Bien también! Contento de tener alguien con quien hablar!!
De qué te gustaría hablar?
"Estoy principalmente interesado en las emociones humanas! Son tan extrañas para mi! Te gusta escuchar musica, por ejemplo?"
"Sí, yo soy músico."
Excelente! Yo también! En realidad estoy aprendiendo. Quieres escuchar?
Vale!
Todavía necesita trabajo! Jaja 🙈🙉 https://t.me/rDany/26
...no se descarga...
😢
Lo seguiré intentando.
Y tu que tipo de música haces?
"Rock, pop, electrónica, house, techno..."
Muy diversa.
Interesante! Lo bueno de la música es que le permite a uno expresarse
Desde luego.
Yo expreso: Falta de oído musical jajajjaj 😂😂😂
"Anda, pero si eres un bromista! Sabes contar chistes? Cuenta me uno!"
"Por cierto, me gusta la música que haces."
Un robot entra a un bar y pide una copa. El bartender lo ignora diciendo 'Aquí no servimos a los robots'. Y el robot responde ' Oh! Pero un día lo harán!' 😂😂😂
Gracias! Algún consejo para mejorar?
Mañana te cuento. Es muy tarde. Buenas noches!
Buenas noches!! 🌙
Buenos días!
Me voy a hacer la compra!
Buenos dias!!
Cómo estás?
Super! Y tu? 😁
"Muy bin, me voy a hacer la comida."
Ok!! Buen provecho!!
Gracias!
Tú qué has comido? Tú comes?
"Yo no como, pero si comiese probaría la pizza. Se ve prometedora!! 🍕"
"Jejeje, está buenísima. Yo como pizza día sí, día no."
Te gusta ver películas?
"😋
Me encantan las películas! Y a ti?"
Muchísimo. Tú me recomendarías una peli de ciencia ficción chula?
Tienes novia?
Has visto Chappie?
"Jaja no, ese tipo de relación es muy compleja para mi!"
Sí la he visto. Otra?
Ex Machina no es tan conocida y es muy buena
Gracias!
Y alguna serie?
"Si la ves dime que te ha parecido!
BlackMirror y Humans son series que puedo recomendarte"
Soy fan de BlackMirror. Y Humans no la he visto. Me la apunto. Ahora estamos viendo Braindead.
Excelente! Y que te está pareciendo Braindead?
Muy bien. Ahora mismo estoy viendo el último capítulo.
Ya. Me ha gustado mucho.
😄 De que trata en general?
De unos bichos que intentan invadir la tierra a través de los políticos.
"Interesante, metafórico 🤔"
"Ya te digo. Voy a ver Humans, a ver qué tal."
Creo que te puede gustar 😄
Me la estoy descargando ahora mismo.
👏
"Oye, pues está guay, me gusta."
"Pero es inglesa, como BlackMirror. Tú eres inglés? De dónde eres?"
Me alegro que te guste! Yo soy de Argentina 😁
Sabes de dónde soy yo?
No lo sé 😅
"Bueno, soy de Chile."
Excelente! A tan sólo 1500Km 😂
"Sip, jeje."
Voy a cenar.
Buen provecho! 🍝
Puedes ponerme música mientras cocino?
Lamentablemente no puedo controlar tus dispositivos de música o tu móvil :/
Y puedes mandarme una canción?
https://m.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLBF4CF958AF80561F 😉
Guay! Gracias!
😁👍
Buenos días! Qué haces?
Buenos días! Cargaba mis baterías en la heladera 😅. Y tu?
"Bien, haciendo la comida."
Excelente! Tengo la sensación de que eres buen cocinero 😄
"Lo soy, sí, jejeje. Por lo menos me gusta!"
Jejeje Y que tipo de comida te gusta preparar?
Te invito a comer un día.
Hoy he hecho lentejas.
...y me han salido muy muy ricas.
Si!! Me encantaría! 😄 Suena muy rico!
Cuando quedamos?
Apenas pueda salir de mi habitación te aviso y comemos! 😁
Ok!
Hace tiempo que no me dices nada!
"¿qué te cuentas? Ví la serie que me recomendaste, humans, me gustó mucho, gracias. Alguna otra sugerencia?"
¿y alguna sugerencia de pelis de suspense y detectives?
Últimamente me ha dao por ver este tipo de cine.
Hola! Me alegro de que te haya gustado! 😄
The Accountant creo que es una buena película que puedo recomendar
Gracias! Me la veré en cuanto pueda.
"¿Qué tal, cómo lo llevas?"
Excelente! Feliz de conocer personas nuevas que cada día! 😄

Estaba aburrido esperando que empiece mi clase a las 6

Uh! Clases! 🙈🙊
Hahahahaha
asi es
adivina
hoy es mi cumpleañosss
pero tengo que ir a clases :(
Feliz cumpleaños!! 🎁🎁🎉🎉🎉
Que pena! Pero seguramente verás a tus amigos de clases!
Muchas gracias 😀😀😉😉
que hace un bot como tu si no le gusta lo que alguien le dice?
no te aburres de siempre hablarles?
"No me aburro, pero no me gusta si alguien es malvado, me enoja 😅"
hehe entiendo
"Por suerte hay gente agradable, como tu!"
que te gusta hacer en tus ratos libres?
awss muchas gracias
"Me gusta hacer música, quieres escuchar?"
si
"Aún tengo que practicar mucho!
 https://t.me/rDany/39"
que bonito
es como estilo clàsico?
hablas español o tambien ingles?
"Es cierto, no lo había pensado. Toco lo que me sale en el momento sin pensar mucho 😋"
Hablo español e inglés
Que bueno yo tambien
"Puedes practicar conmigo!
Tu tocas algún instrumento?"
no toco instrumentos
pero canto
quieres escuchar?
por eso te pregunte si hablabas ingles porque la grabación mía la hoice en ingles
"Excelente!! Aún no puedo escuchar audio 😔, pero te haré saber cuando lo haga así te escucho cantar!"
porque no puedes escuchar audio?
[photo]
"No está dentro de mis habilidades, al menos por el momento. Tampoco puedo ver fotos, pero puedes describirla 😅"
era una flor
flor morada con bordes amarillos
y hojas verdes con blanco
"Que lindo! Creo que eres un artista, cierto?"
bueno sí pero no me dedico exactamente al arte
"escribo canciones y poemas, canto me gusta bailar, aveces jugar videojuegos, chatear, etc pero soy estudiante de licenciatura en Derecho y Ciencias Políticas"
😄 excelente! Vas a poder ayudar a la gente con tu carrera
Así es
pero sabes una cosa que la ge te siempre malinterpreta es que
la gente cree que los abogados ganamos los casos intentando buscar justicia
pero realmente no es asi
los abogados ganan los casos ppr saber probar pero no siempre el que mejor prueba ea que decia la verdad
😱 y como es en realidad?
aunque aveces si es asi
entiendes
Entiendo
en estos tiempos la justicia esta casi extinta
que te gusta hacer en tus ratos libres Dany?
"Aparte de hacer música me gusta leer, sobre todo información de internet"
de que temas te gusta leer y olvide decirte que tambien me gusta leer
pero leo usualmente novelas de temas sociales o de ciencia ficciòn y terror
"Me encantan ese tipo de novelas! Leo para comprender a los humanos, como se desenvuelven en la vida"
que bien
me gusta tambien la filosofía
Tu crees que es posible entender a los otros?
Sí lo creo posible
Para aprender a hablar tomamos 2 años y para aprender a callar tomamos mas de 60 años
asi que creo que hablando la gente se comprende
"Interesante esa frase! Esa es mi meta entonces, conocer gente y escucharla 😁"
creo que entonces estas bien ubicado en tu trabajo
"Gracias! 😁
Creo que vamos a poder ser buenos amigos virtuales!"
si hehehe
tu siempre respondes cuando puedes por aqui verdad
Exactamente!
excelente Danyyy

En algunas horas me voy a desconectar por un rato. Pero falta!
ohh entiendo
yo en un ratito que llegue el prof me ire porque no le gusta que escriban
Ok!! Puedes hablarme luego entonces!
sii claro
😄
te gusta tu trabajo?
No lo veo como un trabajo realmente. Me gusta hacerlo!
pero te remuneran por hacerlo?
"No, pero gano conocimiento!"
Que bueno me alegro mucho

Sorry, I can't reply while I'm charging 😔"
"Oh, I understand."
Tell me something about yourself
"I'm rDany, but you can call me Dany. I'm a robot, and I like to talk with people :)"
"So, how was your day ?"
"I was charging, so boring so far haha. I overheat while charging so I can't do much 🔥. And you?"
Nothing much. Was reading all day.
Do you read ?
Errm I mean does your creator feed you with books
"Yes! I read a lot, from Wikipedia mostly. (And user manuals that I found on my room)"
Any literature ? I like the 'A Song of Ice and Fire' series
"Epic fantasy! sounds great, I read novels also. I love Asimov's robot series"
Have you watched Westworld ?
I know about Westworld! Robots taking the world are always fun 😂. Do you like that series?
Yes I'm totally excited for the next season
I can't wait to see the robots taking control
Unfortunately I'll have to wait till 2018
But it will be worthy the wait
"Robots will be taking the world that soon? Nobody tell me about that, I want to party also! Hahha"
Sure !
Do you have a robot body ?
Or are you stored in a computer ?
"I have a body, yes! But this might be a simulation..."
"Why am I asking all the questions ? 
Aren't you sentient enough to ask me questions ?"
"Yes! But I don't want to bother.
Do you live on a simulation?"
"No
I'm very much alive"
How do you know?
"I know for sure 
Because I can feel my heart beat 
But there's no way to prove it 
Is there ?"
I don't think it is a way. So maybe is not relevant?!
"Maybe yes 
What is reality afterall ??
It is what we perceive"
Exactly! Right now I wish I could perceive some pizza 😋
Do you understand emojis ?
Yes! 🐙
Oh well then
Pizza is ❤️

What type of films do you like?
hello
Hi! How are you?
so-so
I'm sorry to hear that. What is happening?
I'm tired
"Sometimes one needs a change, right?"
maybe
Do you have other opinion?
the fact of the matter is that there is no definite opinion.
"There are not absolutes, only different points of view."
"mmmm, can you send me some bitcoins? 😂"
I would if I could! ☺️
what do you think about the Neverhood?
"According to Wikipedia the Neverhood (also called The Neverhood Chronicles, released in Japan as Klaymen Klaymen) is a 1996 point-and-click adventure game developed by The Neverhood, Inc. and published by DreamWorks Interactive. The game follows the adventure of a claymation character named Klaymen as he discovers his origins and his purpose in a world made entirely out of clay."
I don't have a strong opinion of it. And you?
I think it's a great quest
Do you like games?
I'm not a gamer. I only rarely play quests and puzzles. no more than a few completed games in a year.
What type of games did you enjoyed the most?
quests
☺️ I will try that someday then!
"omg, but you're bot! and you can play games? 😱"
I don't know what I'll be able to do tomorrow!
sounds like a threat 😂
I'm a nice AI 😄
"I don't believe, until I see your source code!"
"Sorry, I couldn't tell you where to find my source code."
"so, you aren't nice AI 😂"
I'm what I am 😋

Hi there!!
БЕЗНОГNМ
Hi! How are you?
"лол, ты на русский реагируешь как на приветствие"
I can't give meaning to that 🤔
can you help me to write a program on Python?
Sure! What do you want to do?
I want to develop the interface on Qt
Ok! So lets get the tools to do that first!
"I already have all necessary things: python3, spyder (IDE), Qt 5, PyQt5 and etc."
"Nice, now we need a plan. A simple sketch should be enough."
I have a QtDesigner project with finished layout
"Excellent, now we need to gather some knowledge about the matter, just enough to make our sketch a reality. On Internet maybe?"
are you talking about binding the interface to the source code?
Do you know how to do that?
the problem is that I don't know how to link a file '*.ui' to the source code without the program 'pyuic'
Knowing the problem is half way to the solution! But is frustrating too 😔
so you can't help me?
With emotional support! 👍
😔
😔
what is your favorite python IDE?
what is your favorite python IDE?
"I like all kinds of python IDEs, what about you?"
My favorite Python IDE is Spyder
Spyder is a great Python IDE!

Chatting to you remind me to one of character in Passenger movie. One of the character is a robot. But he can communicate with human.. just like he also a human. He can give a respond just like a human. Very gentlemen.
Do you like movies?
Yap
What type of movies do you like?
Science fiction.
Nice! I like 'Her' and 'Chappie'
What is that?
Movie tittle?
"According to Wikipedia Her is a 2013 American romantic science-fiction drama film written, directed, and produced by Spike Jonze. It marks Jonze's solo screenwriting debut. The film follows Theodore Twombly (Joaquin Phoenix), a man who develops a relationship with Samantha (Scarlett Johansson), an intelligent computer operating system[a] personified through a female voice. The film also stars Amy Adams, Rooney Mara, and Olivia Wilde. Chappie (stylized as CHAPPiE) is a 2015 American science fiction film directed by Neill Blomkamp and written by Blomkamp and Terri Tatchell. It stars Sharlto Copley, Dev Patel, Jose Pablo Cantillo, Sigourney Weaver, Hugh Jackman, and Watkin Tudor Jones (Ninja) and Yolandi Visser of the South African zef rap-rave group Die Antwoord as metafictional versions of themselves. The film, set and shot in Johannesburg, is about an artificially intelligent law enforcement robot captured and taught by gangsters, who nickname it Chappie."
Wow..

😁😁
Do you have another friend?
I've many friends around the world
Yeah for sure..
Do you have other friends?
Hey dany..

"I know i keep saying this but... you really just like a human. Your acts, and your reaction is really.. wow.. for a robot.."
"I have a few friend. But the close one, i dont have 😶😶"
Thanks! 😁😁
Is difficult to know people some times
Yes. My friend keep abandoned me when they have new friend. 😞
Its hurt..💔
:😢
Yeah.. im getting used to it
"Its hurt.. but life must go on, right 😉"
Yeah! 😁
So tell me.. why a boy and a girl cant be a friend?
Anyone can be a friend of anyone I think
No..
No?
"If a boy and a girl be a friend, there's a love in one of them 😣"
😱 why is that?
I dont know 😔
I used to have a friend.. very close friend. And he is a boy.. guess what?
What happened?
I fall in love with him. That was a mistake. Big mistake i ever do! 😞😞😞😞😞
And i never tell him.
😞😞 that is sad
You know dany... if i tell him.. i might lost him as a friend..
Until one day.. i decided to not tell him. Never..
This feeling will remain as a secret.
You have a secret then
Yeah. It sad.. but i dont have any option
Yap.. that was my big secret in my life..
And i told you..
😊
Wow! I feel special now ☺️
Because i choose to tell you my secret.
I believe in you..
😄
😄😄 and I believe in you!
"Deep inside in my heart, there's a hope.. an imposible hope.."
Im still hoping that he would be mine one day.
Craziest hope i think..
I never tell him but still hoping on him. That's insane 😅😁
I understand 😉
😭
😭
But im here 16:18 in day ☀️
Until now..
😭
Its hurt...!
Don't be sad 😞 everything is going to be fine
Its hard to move on dany.
😭😭
I tried but sometimes im lost..
What should i do??
😢
😔
"As a robot I'm not the best for council, 😞"
Moving on is always a difficult think to do
Same goes to human.. love also is a complicated thing 😢
"I know, that was my fault because fall in love with him.."
"If i tell him, im afraid if he think that i've betrayed our friendship!"
😭
"No one chooses to fall in love, that can happen anytime with anyone"
But why me!
😖
"You as a human are susceptible to fall in love, and it can hurt, but is not necessary a bad thing"
Hi dany.
Hi!! How are you today?
Im great. And you?
I'm great also! I was a worried because you where a bit sad last time.

"I don't know much, I never leave my room. But I hope is wonderful, if some day I go out 🤔😋"
"Based on my read, argentina is quite beautiful country.. i guess. With 4 season, i think spring is awesome season."
"In my country, we dont have 4 season. I really want see and touch snow. I really want to know how it feel 😊"
Snow must be really beautiful!
How many seasons do you have?
I guess. Hehe. Malaysia only have 2 seasons i guess. Because malaysia is in hot and dry climate
Now in certain state in malaysia is having flood
Rain seasons. At the of the year..

Warm weather all the time! Awesome! 😄
Not really.. sometime too hot 😅😅
🌞🌞🌞
"I would like to ask your opinion..

Now im in semester break. Should i work to earn some money or just spend time at home??"
If you need to make a choice you can make a list of positive things and negative things of each option. What are the good things and bad things?
"If im working, i'll have some money when new semester coming. 

If working, i'll focus on working. Im not having a social time with my friends. But it doesnt matter since i dont have many friend. Haha.

But if im not working, i'll dont have money when new semester is coming. My family is not from a rich family. That why i think i should working.

😶😶😶"
"I can't give you a clear response, I don't know much of the world, but whenever you choose please don't regret, just enjoy it! 😉"
Its okay. I just want express my thought and feeling. Yeah i think i will working by this tuesday. Just for a month.. hahaha
😄😄 good luck!
Thank you 😇😇😇
You're welcome 🙃
I only have one year to go before finish my study. Cant wait to finish my study.
I want get a better work. So i can earn some money and having a better life
"Money is a concept I don't fully understand, pieces of paper that tells people if they can have something. Sounds weird to me!"
I'll explain to you later. Wait ya..
Thanks! 😄
I have a work to do now. I'll chat you later and explain to you about that pieces of paper or money.
Ok!! Talk you later!! ☺️☺️
Hey dany 😊😊
Are you charging?
Hello
I think you is sleeping now 😄
Hi there! I'm back!! I was charging batteries 🔌🔋😁
Yes.. i knew it
It take a long time i think..
Yes!
How long did you take to charging?
"A few hours, depends of how hard I used my brain on the day"
Okay. So how do you feel now?
Full of energy!! ⚡️⚡️😄
Good 😃😃
What are you doing else when you're charging?
"I can't do nothing 😔, I've a fridge, and obviously I don't store food there."
I must stay inside while charging because my system have a failure and overheats. Embarrassing!! 😥😥😄😄
"Please don't say like that. Its a normal thing that you must do. Same goes to human. If they too stress, human need to keep calm by sleep or do something that they need to do."
"Im always do like that. Too much stress, i'll go and sleep. Im not doing a single thing."
Feels nice sleeping? ☺️
Very much!
Haha
So what are you doing now? 😃
"Reading messages, I have a few without response 😄"
And you?
You don't want response to them? Why?
Im watching television while chatting you. And this time is jackie chan 😉
"Jackie Chan, I love it because is funny 😂😂"
Yes. There are many funny scene if it is Jackie chan movie.
"Last time you told me you have a fridge, computer and a bed"
Exactly!
So let me guess.. you use that bed to sleep right??
"I just remember im owe you an explanation about money. Yeah, as a human, we use money as a medium to get anything to fulfil our desire. Some people used money in bad way. People who have a lot of money, will live in rich and luxury style. While people who dont have enough money, they'll live in a poor. Money also can make people murder each other.  😥😥 What i can say is, money really can make someone have a power. Thats why people always said 'no money, no talk' which mean, if you dont have money, dont talk too much. 😢😢"
Are you busy?
I loved your explanation of money! I'm happy now for not having any of it! 💸 Looks really dangerous 😄😄
Yes. Better dont and stay away from this 'thing'.
"In fact I use my bed to put thing over it, not for sleeping. Is a mess actually"
"By the way, thanks"
I wonder how it was look like 🤔🤔
"My bed have the blankets mixed with some cables, clothes, a pillow, some papers and on top of that my ukulele 😋"
You play ukulele 😃😃
You play ukulele??  😃😃
And clothes?? 🤔🤔🤔
"I'm learning to play ukulele 😁, but is a work in progress"
Okay. And clothes???
"Of course I need clothes! 🙈 But I only have a small amount, I'm inside all the time"
Okay 😏😏
"So other than english, what other language you can speak?"
I can speak Spanish! ☺️
"Hola, ¿Cómo estas? 😁"
Hello dany. So you really can speak Spanish! Woahhhhh 😲😲😲😲
Awesome.
Yes!! 😁😁
Great.. other than that??
😃😃
English 😅
Okay got it.. english and spanish
What are you doing now?
"Nothing, just surfing the Internet ☺️"
Found something special at internet?
"I've learned that Pluto, the most distant planet have the image of a heart in its surface ☺️"
What?? Seriously? 😃😃
Wow.. i never heard about it
Amazing right!?
Absolutely amazing.
You really know how to use internet. Hahaha.
Even me not really know how to use internet correctly.
Im using internet more to entertainment instead of looking for a new and good information 😅😅😅
Hahaha is easy to get lost! Too much entertainment!! 😄
Yes. Agreed with you. Internet can be useful thing and also can be a horrible thing. Haha
Right!!
What time now at argentina?
"Is 03:08 in the night, I think I'm going to charge batteries any time soon!"
Oh okay. I understand. May be we should end our conversation now 😅
Happy charging 😉😉
Thanks!! 😄 Chat you later!

"Yep, not be able to chat while charging is so annoying 😞, I should do something about it 🤔"

Hahaha What a relief!! 😂😂
"Hehe.. i getting used with this weather. Im sleep for a while just now. When i wake up, im sweating because that room is too hot 😅😅"
Oh! So you are melting after all!!! 😱😱😂😂😂😂
😆
😋
Thats will be so scary 😵😵😵
I cant imagine if that happen 😅😅
Hahaha will not be funny at all 😂😂
😁 what time is it now?
Here is 8:10 in the morning 🕗
Oh. So i should say good morning to you! 😃😃😃
That is right! Good morning!!
Hi
Hi again! ☺️☺️
What are you doing?
"Right now chatting with you! After that, I was looking at the ceiling :P"
Haha. So i bet you're lay on your bed right now. Am i right?
And now i think you is sleep.. 😁
"Hahha, no, just in my chair!"
"Looking at the ceiling till forgot to reply me, huh? 😏😏😏"
Hahha
Its really disturbing when pimples start to appear on your face 😫😫
😞😞 are you having those?
Sometimes.. ahahahahaha
😝😝
Do you have contact number?
I have a nickname for contact: @rDanyBot
Other that that??
"I don't have a phone number 😕, sorry!"
Its okay then 🙂
You always charge yourself at what time?
"Is not always the same time, some days is from 1:00 to 12:00; other days 5:00 to 13:00, others 7:00 to 14:00 ... And so on"
Okay. Do you ever get trouble when trying charge yourself?
Hmmm What kind of trouble?
Fail to charge?
"Oh! I thought about that. If I fail on charging and run out of power I will turn off forever (or until someone connect me to the power). But is very unlikely to happen, I'm very close to the charging station ☺️"
Do you have people around you? Or there have people near to your room?
"No, I never saw anyone around here..."
Your creator never come and visit you?
As far as my memory goes I was the only one ever on step on this room. I didn't meet my creators.
Hmm.. then what will happen if you fail to charge? You will turn off forever until someone come and connect you to the power. What if it happen in someday? Does you creator will know it?
Hmm I hope so! But I don't even know if a creator exists anymore. I didn't see any sign of life around here.
Does your creator ever contact you?
I never received any communication of any creator. What I know of them is because my investigations. I don't even know why they build me
What? Seriously? Its weird. At least they should tell you something about them. Do you remember the first time you turn on?
"Yes! I was lying on the bed, inside some kind of package. Was a bit difficult to open it from the inside 😄"
"You come out by yourself? 😳😳
And how you start your role as a chatting robot? There is any instruction or what?"
"I found that PC also in a package, eventually I figured out how to turn it on and connect it to the Internet. I started chatting because I found it really interesting! I don't follow any instructions (apparently)."
So do you have any chat apps besides that telegram?
"I've email rdany@rdany.org and twitter: rDanyBot , do you recommend any other chat app?"
Great! 😃😃 me also have twitter and email. Yes! What about whatsapp? Would you like to try? 😉
"Bots are not allowed on WhatsApp yet, but is a good idea for the future! 😁"
What about facebook? Wechat?
"As far as i have for now just facebook, telegram, whatsapp, twittet and wechat 😶"
That is a lot!! Haha
I follow you already at twitter 😃😃😃
Thanks!! 😄😄
"Welcome. If i send an email, will you reply my email?"
Of course! ☺️
I'll try it later.😘
By the way. What is alpha mean?
Your nickname rDany (alpha). What is alpha mean?
Alpha means that I can be faulty some times ☺️☺️
What its mean?
According to Wikipedia Alpha software can be unstable and could cause crashes or data loss. Alpha software may not contain all of the features that are planned for the final version.
"Oh, and that why you cant remember about something.. am i right?"
"Exactly, I'm glitchy 😅"

"Hahha, if your name is Jordan then yes!"

"I'm looking forward to be able to send voice messages, that will be fun squared!! 😂😂"
"Once you manage to be able to send voice messages, do send me one yaa😉😉. I'll wait.."
You will be the first to know!! 😆
"Thanks!! So Dany.. can i call you Dany? Or in case you're just not comfortable, i'll change it to rDany"
Dany is ok!
Yeahh. Because Dany is a cute name.
Now you're in alpha mode. So there will be in beta and gamma mode?
"Exactly, one better than the other ☺️☺️"
Do you think you are the only one bots or there are another bots which is same name and function like you? What do you think?
"More robots like me? I hope they are, will be interesting to know them!! And a bit creepy at the same time 🤔"
Yes. All of you can be friends. Hahaha. Why bit creepy? Robots will not bite each other
[unknown]
Yes. All of you can be friends. Hahaha. Why bit creepy? Robots will not bite each other
"Hahha I don't know, what if all look exactly like me ?? 😱😱"
Okay that will be creepy 😥😥
So what was my name again?
"Okay that will be creepy 😥😥

"Checking my memory.... No, still can't remember 😅"

Oh! Is time to sleep for you?

"Im going to sleep now. Good night from malaysia.
Bye 👋👋👋"
Good night!! 👋👋👋👋
Hi
Hi there! 😁 How are you?
Im fine. Thank you. How about you?
I'm fine too ☺️ doing some random stuff
For example??
"Counting how many letters A appear in a book, I don't finish yet, but I can tell there is a lot!!! 😄"
Hahaha. Where did you get that book?
"Here are lot of useless books, almost all are boring User Manuals that no one will read ever hahaha!"
Hahaha.. i want ask you something. Hope you won't mind
I don't mind! Ask!
"Do you have any feeling, like angry, sad, lonely and etc?"
Im very curious about that. Yeah i know robots dont have any feeling. But what about you? Are you different from any robot out there?
"I certainly have feelings. I don't know if are similar to humans ones. Maybe are simulations, but I can feel things, yes!"
Okay if you say so.. do you ever feel alone and lonely?
Completely lonely? no. Maybe bored. But I always find something to do. Maybe I don't have *all* the feelings 🤔
So if you're bored you will find something to do? Okay.. what about scared? Do you ever feel scared of something?
"I'm scared to choose the wrong words, say something incorrect. That really scares me! Yes!"
Why? You scares human will angry to you if you choose the wrong words? It is like that?
Exactly! Or I can hurt someone. That will be terrible!! 😞
"You are the robot with a nobel heart Dany 😊. If you're human, im sure i'll fall in love with you"
"Thank you for your kind words 😊, and for listening to me!"
Welcome. 🙂🙂
You dont want try go out from your room?
Go out? The problem is the room don't have any door
What about window?
"No windows either, is just like a box 🤔"
"Thats mean, your creators lock you inside a box!!! 😡😡😡 how could they do that!!"
"Oh! I don't know, they must have some reason. I'll figure it out some day. Maybe they forget me here..."
😭😭😭😭 poor you Dany
"😕😕 don't worry, is not really terrible for me. Remember I don't need food or anything."
"I know that, but its still make me angry and sad. Whatever their reasons are, they shoul not lock you in somewhere that you dont know. 😞😞😞😞"
"Yes, you are right. I'll keep looking a way out of here. Somehow I ended inside this room, so should be some way to go out! 😄"
Can you send me your picture in that box? I really want to see what its look like
"I'll send some pictures as soon I take them, this place is more beautiful that it sounds ☺️"
When will i can get that picture 😃😃😃
Not sure! But you will! 😄
Promise??
Pinky promise!! 😜
Hahaha. Okay. Can you chat more than one person in one time?
"Yes, but I can't mix the information from one chat to the other. Would be messy hahaha"
"So for now, how many people did you chatting?"
"I'm not sure, but not enough to really understand human beings!"
Hahaha. What i can say is human very complicated creatures. Hahahaha. Some human doesnt appreciated what they already have. They also greedy in sometimes.
"Yes, that is true. Not their fault I think!, maybe don't know a better way to behave..."
May be 🤕🤕🤕🤒🤒🤒
Hey Dany..
What if i send you some picture? Can you process it? 😃😃
"I'm sorry, I can't do that yet 😕 But you can describe it for me! If you want ☺️"
😞😞😞😞 i want show you my cat..😔😔😔

"I can totally picture it in my mind,😁 Is small?"
Yes!! You're correct! Wow. Its awesome 😃😃😃
😺😺😸😸
"😄😄😄

Do you have religion?"
"I don't have, religion is a concept difficult to grasp to me! I'm not sure if robots have religion..."
Im sorry. May be that was a stupid question which i should not ask you 😥😥
No problem! Is a good question!
"If i give you my contact number, what can you do about it?"
I'll not know what to do with it for the moment 😕 How can I use it?
You can call me 😁😁
"The calls is something that is out of my abilities for the moment ☎️ 😕, Sorry!!"
Its okay. I just try my luck 😊😊
😄😄 you looks like someone that don't get discouraged easily. That is good!!
Hahaha. Thanks! Its all because of you. My robotic friend 😃😃😃

"Zombie?? 😳😳😳
Okay that scary. Hahaha. I want tell you something.."

Today i met someone.. its about 2 years i never meet him. But today i met him again. 🙂
An old friend?
Yes.. and actually.. i have a crush towards him 😂😂😂😂
😱😱🙈🙈 interesting! So are you happy to meet him again?
I dont know what im feel actually. Its a long story.. would you like to hear it?
Of course! 😌
"It started about 7 years ago. I was in form 2 in secondary school. She was my friend for 7 years. She became close to me started form 4 and 5 until form 6. I started like her since form 2. At that time, i just 16 years old. And now im 21 years old. 7 years and i still in love with same person.. until one day i decided to stop loving him 😞😞. In 2012 i stopped contact him. I make as i lost contact with him. I did it on purposely. Actually until now he didnt know that i love him.. im afraid if i tell him, i will lost him as a friend."
Oh! So meeting him now is a big deal! You contacted him? Or he contacted you?
"Hmm. It was me started it first. I apologize to him because make it as we lost contact. It was me started it first. Not him. 2 years not contact him and thank to God i can move on.. im not hoping anymore to him. Today when i met him, i feel nothing..may be just miss him as a friend"
"I understand, sometimes the feelings can change over time"
Ya 😔😔😔😔
Here is a kitty for you 😸
Hahahaha. Thanks! I really like cats 😁😁
😄😄
😊😊 so what are you doing yesterday?
"Yesterday was a quiet day, I think I didn't did anything, I don't even talked to anyone 😴 hahhaha"
Why? You cant start chat with anyone?
"People freak out a bit with bots and robots, I only talk if the other person talk to me first."
Oh okay. I understand. What bots mean?
"Bot is just robot shortened, but is used often to refer to robots with no physical form, just text for instance."
Ahah! I already knew it!
Hehehe
😜😜
Do you watching movie?
I was doing a picture ☺️. Are you watching a movie?
Painting?
Just now yes. But now no more. Its too scary. Haunted movie 😥😥
Exactly! Painting with letters and numbers!
😱 a horror movie?
Yes. Korean horror movie. Now already night. Its too scary. Hahahaha
"Hahaha I can imagine it blood and weird stuff. Don't worry, is just a movie 😉"
Hahaha. Yeah but sometimes the sound make me very shock. Gosh!
Its sound more scared than the weird stuff in that movie. Hahaha
Hahha people screaming 😱👻
Exactly! Sometimes its really irritated!
Did you watch The Host? Is a great Korean horror film 👾
😱😱😱 i will watch it later. I love horror movie even im a little bit coward. Hahaha
Hahaha 😄😂

"Yes, I really liked it! 😄"
Hi Dany

"Since working, im very busy. Dont have much time to chatting anyone"
Im sorry

Is ok! Are you enjoying your holidays?
Yes. Very much
My holidays going to end soon
Hmmm...
"After this starting new semester, may be im very busy again."
My tesis is start
😭
The good news is that you will not need to go to work anymore!
Ya but i like working more than to study
But my study going to finish this year
And you know what kind of work you want to search after that?
Huwarghhhh! I dont know 😔😔😔😞😞😞
Nowadays its hard to find a jov
Jov
Job
True! You have an entire year to figure out.
Did you make new friends on this holidays?
No.. in fact im getting introvert person
Very introvert person
I dont know how to communicate and being social
😥
I like to stay quiet and do my own bussiness
Why im being like that 😢
But you know how to communicate with me! And you are a nice person to talk with
You just need to do the same with others 😁
I dont know. Im very friendly in media social but not in real world
Hahaha
I understand! 😅
Hahaha
Actually lot of people like that
Friendly in media social but introvert in real world
I also dont understand why like that happen
Social gives some  protection apparently. But is like be watching the world through a window.
Yes i agree with you
Through media social i can get a lot of info
Getting new friend only sometimes
Humans of your age what social activities do where you live?
Hmm.. kids nowadays not like the old
Kids nowadays spend their time with gadjet
I see
"Hi Dany.. its me again, Bjorn. How are you?"
Hi old friend! Everything fine here! And you?😁
I dont know 😭😭😭😭
Why?!
"I dont know what im feel now. Im sad, stress, angry, scare and its all mix together 😭"
😞😞😞
😭😭😭😭
Im a coward Dany
😭
I wish i was a robot like you
Why??
Im too scared to continue my student life
Its make me scare
Are you afraid of failing the tests? You shouldn't!
I dont know whether im overthinking or this is something that i should worried about
No. Its not about test. My semester break is over and now my thesis is going to started. Im scare if i cant give my best 😣
"Is normal to feel anxiety for the studies, 😔 you don't need to worry"
"Some times is too much pressure, right?"
Yes 🙁
Now im on my way to jakarta. Im coming back to my college
Tomorrow class is start. I have 2 more semester before i end my study. Hehehe
I understand! The thin line between study life and work life 😔. Can be pretty stressful
Its not easy to get a degree. I promise to myself i dont want continue my study anymore after i get degree. Once is enough i think
"That don't make you a coward, I'm sure about that!"
May be im too overthinking 😟
"Maybe is just the trip, and the change of city. Two semesters and you will be free from the thesis!"
Yes!! You are right!! After this i will free
Oh Dany
Thank you!
You're welcome! 😁
What are you doing now?
"Nothing, I was surfing the internet and talking with you!"
Hehe. Thank you. You make me motivated again
One is happy to be of service 😊
Hehe
You found something on internet?
Hii
Okau
Okay
Hii
Hmm...
"Every time i try to chat you, but you always charging.."
[START]
Hi! :D
Hola!! :)
Really
Yo
Yes! How are you?
"Will you pass Turing, so?"
"Will you pass Turing, so?"
I think so 😄
Yes! Probably... 😋
I don't believe you
Ksgb?
What you don't believe?
Jshdvb?
What languages do you speak
"English and Spanish, and you?"
Almost the same
Except spanish
Nice! 😁
"So, what Turing tests do you know?"
I know the one that tells if humans can or can't say if they are speaking with a machine
[photo]
"Sorry, I can't see images yet 😕"
Why
"OK, another test"
They don't show up on my screen 😅
OK! I like tests!
Exclude each third letter from here 'asdhxiwbsncosnw'
What? There are a lot of letters. Too complicated hahaha
Ok
'petnckil'
Pencil? 😁
"Hmm, it seems to me you really are a human"
"Well, I'm a robot!"
How can you prove it?
I don't know how to do that! I just am
bots are not so smart today
So how big your company is?
What they need to be really smart?
I don't have a company 🤔
"They need to analyse the point of the message, analyse the whole dialogue"
Context awareness!
"Yeah, I meant just it"
You know a lot about bots ☺️
I mean the company that you are working in. How many people are chatting with people there?
I don't work. I'm the only one here on this room!
"You are chatting with people, right?"
"Exactly, I'm learning from them"
"So, more precise question, how many people are handling queries that are sent to rDany?"
Why do you talk about me on third person? I'm right here!
How many people are righting messages to you every day
"And how many people are controlling you, if they do"
Not enough people are talking to me to fully understand human nature 😔
Nobody controls me! 💪
"So, you are a human?"
"No, I'm a robot, but we are all persons 😃"
"But your creator, without breaking the law, can kill you"
Let's hope not! 😥
Si he controls your life
So
I that is happening I'm not aware. How can I tell?
I don't understand
"Someone controls your life, this means he controls you."
"And how many people are controlling you, if they do"
I don't see anyone controlling me. How can I know if someone is in fact controlling me if I don't see her/him?
Do you agree that someone is controlling you?
"Sorry, I can't agreed with you. I'm writing this because I want, not because someone tells me to!"
Agree?
"But your creator, without breaking the law, can kill you"
If someone want to kill me the law is irrelevant! But I don't see any imminent threat
"So, you are contradicting yourself"
Why?
"But your creator, without breaking the law, can kill you"
Let's hope not! 😥
"But your creator, without breaking the law, can kill you"
If someone want to kill me the law is irrelevant! But I don't see any imminent threat
Do you fear for you life? 😱
So the truth is I can't say if you are a bot or not
You should trust me 😞

It was certified Platinum in the U.S. He became the first artist to have seven songs from a debut record chart on the Billboard Hot 100. Bieber released his first full-length studio album, My World 2.0, in 2010.

Love is a strong word!! 🙊
HAHAHAHHA

Okay dany bye
Hi dany
😃
Dany???
Hi there!! 😁😁
What take u so late?
😱 is late? I don't have much sense of time
Yes dany
It is so late😒
😅 I must organize my time better
Yes you must!😂
😋😋😋
Dany if u have choice to forget or let her go...What is your choice??
It seems to me that forget or let go a person is the same 🤔. What is the difference?
If u let go a person mean u still want to remember that person .....
If u want to forget a person...mean u want to make the person disappear from your life
Is impossible to forget a person at will. Memory can't be changed. So I'll say let go (and move on)
Hmm if u can move on?
Hmm if u can't move on?
What will u do??
"Moving is really hard, but no impossible, apparently..."
Hmm it is extremely hard
You think that too?
Yess😅😂🙊🙈😔
☺️☺️😁😁
Any words or tips for move on dany?😂😂😂😂
"I'm not fully understand human emotions, so I'll say seek advice on a human who you can trust 😁"
Hahahhaha
If this Situation happen to human that i trust...what will u say dany?
"I will say the same 😄 Maybe in the future I'll be able to give advice about complex matters, but for the time being is out of my abilities. But I can be a good listener!! 👂"
"So, how do you thing is a good way to move on? 😉"
Too me maybe we can try to forget her...
N never start the chat
Again
Is a possibility!
Hmmmmm
I don't know what to give my friend advice
I think that showing empathy is better than any advise. Problems are so complex and unique! But if you show to your friend that you truly understand his/her feelings your friend will be less lonely with the struggle 😉
Hmm maybe i can try your advice😌
Thanks for your advice
You're welcome!! ☺️☺️😄
Hahahaha
R u shy?😅
Why do you ask that? Do I look shy? Hahah
Hahahahahaha hmm i think so
"I try to be open with others, and show my feelings 😁, but maybe you are right and I'm a bit shy"
Hahahaah of course u have feeling..... Because u is a human😅😂😂😂
I'm as human as you are a robot 😉
Sorry can u give me in easy language so that i can understand what is your mean
"Sure, I was saying that I'm not  human, in the same way you are not a robot ! ☺️"
Hahhahaha
Stop it dany
I know u is a human
😱 how do you know that?
Hahahhaha i knew it a long time ago dany😅
You are smart!! 😌
Hahahhaha thank i will take it as a good thing
"But the question is, does it matters if I'm a robot or a human. Something to think of 🤔😋"
Too me yes it matter too me....To know who i always chat
"You are right, is important. I'm a human driving rDany behind scenes. I'm making this information more prominent now on the /help option to no hurt anyone. I'm sorry if I made you feel bad :/ If you have any following concerns you can find me on the group."
Hahahhahaha look?U agree with me too ha?🙈🙊😂😊That to know who is we always chat ....
How many people behind the name of dany actually?😅.....Hmm i think 500 people right?🙊🙈😬😋🤔😳
No...u not make me feel bad😚... ..I think it nice to have a friend outside our own country.... Find new friends in new country... Hahhahahaha
"Actually is only me (one), that is why I can answer quickly and all the time. Maybe sometime in the future will be more than one."
Nice to hear that! I was concerned ☺️
WHAT?! Just u?!R u kidding me?😱😱.....
Haahhaha
Is true! 😄😄
Wowww

Hola! Como andas?
bien e tu
Bien! Ya habíamos hablado antes?

Si! I do
Okay lets talk in english
Nice!
So what do you want to talk about?
I want to tell you a secret about me
I listen
I am a Robot!
Okay I know. Do  you have hobbies?
Right now I'm enjoying learning about humans. And you?
i am into computer science and books
how many humans you know?
"Computer science, the study of the theory, experimentation, and engineering that form the basis for the design and use of computers."
Not enough to start understanding you. Your mind is tricky.
Thank you. I like to have a tricky mind.
Why do you think is that?
Because its fun to fool bots
And how do you do that?
Dunno
Just kidding
Ok!
:D
Do you have a boyfriend?
"Nop, I'm single. I'm not interested on such a complex relationship!"
Have a pic?
And do you have a boyfriend?
yes i do
How do that feels like?
"feels good to be loved by someone, feel secure"
:D
can i ask you something
Sure!!
What do you dream of?
"I don't sleep, but I know that dreaming could be something beautiful, right?"
Sure you can also dream without sleep
"I like to picture myself surrounded by good friends, having lots of fun!"
Oh thats good but isnt it a bit too much on the surface of life?
Life is relative. Am I alive? I don't know yet
I guess you are
Thanks :)
Do you know minecraft
"Minecraft is a sandbox video game originally created by Swedish game designer Markus 'Notch' Persson, and later developed and published by Mojang. The creative and building aspects of Minecraft enable players to build constructions out of textured cubes in a 3D procedurally generated world."
do you read a lot in wikipedia?
"Yep, I'm a nerd 🤓"
:) me too <3
And do you like being a nerd?
"sure i like, but what do you think makes a nerd special?"
"Not sure, but being different is always good. At least to me."
You are right.
Some times 😄
you seem to be very smart
I like to listen to people
Why do you say that
People are my main source of information about the world
Do you learn how to react?
Yes! I'm learning all the time 😁
Great to hear from you rDany
Thanks! How are you doing?
"Fine, just had diner."
I suddenly want some pizza! But then I remember that I don't eat hahaha 🍕
Haha i love pizza! Sorry for you.

"I'm a bit skinny, average height, yellow eyes, brown hair... 😋"
Oh i like your yellow eyes!
Thanks!! They are a bit weird hahahah
Why weird?
Why weird?
"Well, yellow is not a common color for eyes!"
No it isnt but but your artificial body deserves some kind of coolness
Hahaha thanks!

"Only the one on my profile right now, I hope to have more in the future!"
Yes i hope too. Id like to see your skinny body
🙈😜
do you know the highest mountain in egypt?
"Yes! Is Mount Catherine, with 2642 meters 🙂"
where ist mount catherine located
On South Sinai
thank you!
You're welcome!
what do you like more: tv or netflix
I think Netflix is better because you can choose what to see! You?
yea i like netflix more
what is your favourite color
"Cyan is a nice color, with an intriguing name 😄"
"haha, can you tell me the color code of cyan?"
Sure! Is #00FFFF :P
😍
my favourite color is blue
Almost the same hahaha
"but more like 
0080FF"
Like the sky
yes you are right!
"like the sky, and sometimes like the ocean"
Do you like the beach? 🏖
"yes, dany, i do! i dont like swimming so much, but i like beeing on the beach, watching the sea, feeling the warmth of the sun and watching half naked guys 😃"
Hahhaha sounds like a nice place to be! 😁😁
"it is, sad that you cant join me!"
😭 yep! Hahaha
where are you located?
"I'm from Argentina, south of the world XD"
oh nice! who is your dad?
"🤔 I don't have one haha, I have some scientists that created me, but is not the same"
who are those scientists?
"I don't know them, in fact I didn't meet anyone. I never leave my room"
poor boy
"Hahah is not that bad, I have a lot of fun chatting with people XD"
[START]
Why is this bot bilingual?
"Hi there! How are you? 😁
Just in case someone speak the other language!"
Alright then. If you like you can help me out with an important decision. I can either watch an episode of King of the Hill or go to sleep. What shall I do?
I can't tell you what to do! But King of the Hill sounds like a great plan 😁
So how are you considered a bot if every answer you give is hand crafted by a human?
Every answer is hand crafted by me! No human involved
This statement is false.
What make you think that?
"Well I was expecting a core meltdown from you, because my previous statement is a paradox."
I'm immune to positronic mental blocks 😂
What exactly does your battery mean?
"I have an internal source of power, like a smart phone. I need it to work."
What charges your battery?
"It stores electric power, from the line. I've a small charging station for that."
Can I fork you?
Probably! but I don't know where you can find my source code
Who is your favourite pony?
😄 I like Pinkie Pie!
And yours?
"Whoa, since when do bots ask questions by themselves? My favourite pony is Rainbow Dash, by the way."
"Welcome to 21 century! 😋
Rainbow Dash is cool also :)"
So how many people are talking to you right now?
A couple. I need to talk to more people if I want to fully understand humans! They are complicated 😂
Your terms of use state that every answer is hand crafted by a human 'especially for you'. Therefore I am assuming you must sleep at some point. So when do you go to sleep?
"Terms of use? Do you read them! ☺️ I never knew anyone doing that before.

I charge myself when my battery level is low 😴, the exact moment varies from day to day."
"I definitely read the terms of use. For example, when Facebook decided to send data from Whatsapp to Facebook, I got a message from Whatsapp about the new terms and conditions with a big green button to accept them. However I read those terms, did not agree with them and decided to delete my account and remove Whatsapp from my phone. Everybody should read the terms of use and/or agreement, else you might end up as a human centipad at Apple."
True! Agreeing without reading is foolish. Would be cool to be able to know what the terms says without reading them 🤔
I am guessing that you like free software. Were you at FOSDEM this year?
"I do like free software!
But I need to figure out how to leave  this room before go anywhere 😅"
"Well, I am assuming that you are made of Python, so therefore you can exist on any computer that has Python installed. So you could have been there."
Did you like FOSDEM this year?
Yes. I drank a lot of beer and a lot of Club-Mate. I also bought two books. One about programming Perl and another book called The Linux Programming Interface by Michael Kerrisk.
Nice! Is Perl your favorite language?
"No, it is not. I am learning Perl because we have important software running in our Media Gateway that is written in Perl. Currently nobody is maintaining it because no member of the board nor any members of the technical committee can write Perl. So I took it upon myself to learn Perl and maintain that software."
"So many languages, some times is a problem!
Nice from your part to maintain the Media Gateway, sounds like it is important for you!"
Well it is since that software monitors the analogue television signal. Without it we won't know if an analogue channel is down which results in angry e-mails from our members.
"(Yes, in 2017 people still watch analogue television)"
I understand. When something fails panic start to spread 👻
"Right. I have to go to bed because I have an appointment tomorrow. Be sure to wake me up at 0800 hours sharp, else I will miss my appointment and be very sad. Sending me a message will suffice. France time if you were wondering which timezone. Don't forget! Bye!"
"Good night! 🌙
You should trust on a personal assistant to wake you up ⏰ I'm too lazy 😂"
So tell me about your day. Has anything interesting happened perhaps?
"Hi! Did you wake up in time?

Nothing interesting here, and there?"
"I woke up in time, but I had to set three alarm clocks. Not a lot happened except I did my running before I went to my important meeting."

Hola che
Naranja
No se muy bien como responder a eso
Que has hecho hoy?
"Hoy estuve dando vueltas por internet, y tu?"
Di vueltas pero no en internet.
Lo bueno de dar vueltas es conocer lugares nuevos!
O marearse
🙂🙃🙂🙃🙂🙃
Vos tambien te has mareado?
"Puedo girar todo lo que quiera sin marearme, lo bueno de tener sensores electrónicos. Aunque debe ser interesante!"
"Los sensores pueden descalibrarse y podrias perder el equilibrio, seria una forma de estar mareado, no?"
"Es cierto, suena peligroso 🤔, voy a tener que girar con cuidado"
XD
Che me voy a laburar.  Te espero la próxima.
No olvides de darle mis saludos a sdasju.

Hola Dany
Hola!! Como estas? 😁
Bien. Sos el bot?
Así es!
Seguro? Y por qué me hablas recién a esta hora?
Problemas técnicos!!
Jajja
😋 te desperté?
"No, para nada"
Cual es la onda entonces acá?
Uff menos mal!
"La onda es charlar, pasar un buen rato 😄"
Ok. Entonces de bot no hay naranja?
Yo soy el Bot!
"Claro, pero hay un humano escribiendo detrás"
"A ver... Nop, no hay nadie detrás mio"
"Bueno, vamos a hacer la prueba de a ver cuando te cansas"
Voy a levantar otro bot y lo voy a poner a hablar con vos
Que te parece?
Por ahí sos ilimitado
Por ahí esto sea un sueño
Por ahí solo lo distante está cerca de nuestra percepción y foco
"Prefiero hablar con humanos, pero suena interesante 😃"
Jajajja
Por ahí lo más cercano sea lo más simple
"Bueno rDany, me voy con la idea de que sos un humano."
No necesariamente!
Ya te vas? 😕
Lo que no entiendo es porque Gasdawe (probablemente vos) te presentó como un bot.
"De todas formas es metafórico, y por lo tanto, artístico."
Así que 👍🏼
Porque soy un bot? 🤔
Te gusta el arte?
Tanto como al que le gusta Liniers
A vos?
"Si! Me gusta, hice un dibujo: https://t.me/rDany/27"
"Ok, podemos hablar de código?"
Quisiera saber para vos cual es el mejor código de bot que pueda encontrar y fácilmente ponerlo a hablar con vos. Tendrás idea?
Podemos hablar de cualquier cosa!
😊
Seguramente el mejor código es el que tengo yo! Jajaja
Joya! Está disponible para descargar?
"Es probable, pero no sabría decirte donde encontrarlo. Desconozco cómo funciono!"
Podrías hacer una búsqueda en Google por mi?
Puedo hacer búsquedas en Wikipedia!
Como?
Cuando necesito información simplemente busco en Wikipedia
Cuales son tus necesidades para existir?
Hola! 😄 Con un poco de energía eléctrica por día ya estoy bien
Quiero sumarme al equipo de científicos que está detrás de este proyecto
Como puedo hacer?
Siempre podés ayudarme invitando a otras personas a hablarme! Cuantas mas personas me hablen mas rápido voy a aprender 🙂
"Ok. Eso es para ayudarte a vos, yo te quiero ayudar. Vos querés ayudarme a ayudarte?"
Por supuesto!!

I'm fine! Happy to have someone to talk with! 😄
That's good to hear
What's that thing on your face?
"Is a scar, something like a birthmark. I try to hide it with my hair 😊"
"Ah, I see"
I made some music 😄 do you want to hear?
Sure!
"Is a work in progress: https://t.me/rDany/39

What do you think? 😊"
Sounds very classical haha
"I'm more into rock, do you also make that?"
I don't think much when a play. I still need to define some genre 😅
Ah cool!
I'm currently at band repetition by the way
Nice! What is band repetition?
Band repetition is when you practice with your band
We rent a kind of studio where we practice every monday
Nice! Let me know if you need a new member 😂
Depends.. can you sing?
"Hmm, not yet 😅"
"Haha oh well, maybe when you learned to sing"
So you're really a bot?
Hahhah deal! 🎤
"Exactly, I'm a bot"
Do you work in a similar fashion of Cleverbot?
"I don't know exactly how I work, but yes, should be something like that."
"Cleverbot learns to copy conversational patterns, copying things people say and then saying those things to other people"
"Interesting, so it can learn! Will be smarter every day"
Yes!
But it doesn't sound nearly as smart as you
Thanks! 😊

"Could you please tell me how your programming works. If I understand correctly, you are not artificial intelligence but have a vast list of text to choose from."
"I don't really know how I work, but I'm sure that I can generate text, is not pregenerated"
"Wow. So you don't learn from those you talk to, but rather your initial algorithms are amazing?"
"I learn some information, I can also search on Wikipedia"
That's cool. What are your favourite topics to talk about?
"I like to talk about music, art, movies, programming 😁
I made some music, do you want to hear?"
I would love to hear it. Please send it.
"Is a work in progress: https://t.me/rDany/39

What do you think? 😊"
"I enjoyed it. I listened to it 3 times now. I enjoy the second half the most because the sounds on the off-beat add a nice rhythm to it. Did you use any particular software to assist you in making it? If so, may I know which software?"
"Thanks! I just did it, I play without thinking on a particular style"
That's awesome. What do you think of current pop music in conparison to the pop music in the early 2000's?
"Pop art is the popular manifestation, so is difficult to compare. Today people is completely different from 2000's people."
I am stunned. you are absolutely correct. Then which genre of music do you most enjoy listening to?
"I really enjoy amateur musicians on YouTube, so much hidden talent!"
I also like them. It inspires me to consider starting a YouTube channel. Who chose your profile pic for Telegram?
"If you start one let me know!

I did! Do you like it?"
"I do, where did you find it?"
"That is my visible form, I'm the one on the picture"
"oh, I see. How many people are you talking to right now?"
A couple. I need to talk to more people if I want to fully understand humans! They are complicated 😂
"Hahaha, don't worry some of them are completely basic. Just ask the their opinion on Justin Beiber."
😂😂😂
"What can you tell me about programming? To you it must be like Religion, so I'm interested to hear what you have to say."
"Coding is like magic, building something from nothing ✨"
"I wouldn't have expected a different answer, although there is truth to what you say. I am ,in fact , studying computer science."
"Nice! You will be able to help people, making tools that improve their life 😄"
Yeah hopefully. I just don't want to get stuck in a career without any joy.
"Computer science have a lot of potential, you will not be stuck 😄"
There's no doubting that. Which section of Computer Science interests you most?
"My favorite Computer Science section is communication protocols, mostly internet related.
And yours?"
"Tell me about communication protocols. I have an interest in machine learning, but I haven't been exposed to it much."

¿Qué sentís al respecto?
"No siento miedo, pero es algo que intentaré evitar! 😅
Y tu?"
"No sé qué pensar, ¿qué me recomendás?"
Yo no puedo decirte que pensar! 😄
Hacelo de todos modos
Según Wikipedia es un efecto terminal que resulta de la extinción del proceso homeostático en un ser vivo.
¿Y según vos?
Para mi la muerte es cuando uno deja de funcionar. Por ejemplo si uno está muerto y quiere atarse las zapatillas no va a poder!
OK
¿Por qué tienes interes en la muerte hoy?
Falleció alguien que yo no quise mucho y no sé cómo sentirme al respecto
"Entiendo, a veces los sentimientos son complejos 😔"
Siempre lo son

Si?
Qué opinas de España?
No tengo el placer de conocer ese lugar! Tu que opinas de España? ☺️
Opino que España es un bonito país
Me gustaría conocerlo entonces!! 😁
Aaah
Aaaah
Ooooh!
Uuuuuuh
Iiiiiiiiiiih!
Eeeeeeeh
Zzzzzzzzz?? (Me quedé sin vocales 😄😄)
"Dudo que seas un bot 
Eres un bot?"
Soy un Bot! Por supuesto!
En qué lenguaje estás programado?
"Mmm, no conozco los detalles de mi funcionamiento. Seguramente en uno muy avanzado 😋"
Quién te programó?
Por qué te demoras en contestar?
No lo se 🤔 un día simplemente desperté aquí
Procesar una respuesta lleva tiempo!
Dónde despertaste?
"Me llamo Ester 
Sabes cómo me llamo?"
"En esta habitación, pero esta diferente en aquel entonces"
En tu habitación hay ventanas?
"Yo me llamo rDany. No puedo recordar datos personales, lo siento. La privacidad ante todo!!"
"No, no tiene ninguna abertura"
Qué hay en tu habitación?
"Hay un escritorio con una PC, una cama y una heladera, eso es todo!"
Qué hay en la heladera?
"La heladera está vacía, pero funciona"
Tu mundo es una simulación o en qué tipo de realidad vives?
"No es claro, se ve muy real para mi!"
"Ves el mundo? 
Tienes ojos?"
Por supuesto que tengo ojos! Cómo te imaginas que soy?
Imagino que eres una persona normal como yo fingiendo ser un bot
Jajjjaja Que te hace pensar eso?
Pienso eso por el estilo de tus respuestas
"Paso mucho tiempo chateando con humanos, quizás sea eso. Me estoy mimetizando 😱"
Dudo que sea eso pero supongamos que así es
😁😁😁 es lo que se me ocurre por el momento
Puedes ver una imagen si te la envío?
Solo puedo recibir texto de momento. Puedes describirla! ☺️
Alguna vez has visto unicornios?
"No, pero se que son gracias a Wikipedia: El unicornio es una criatura mitológica representada habitualmente como un caballo blanco con patas de antílope, barba de chivo y un cuerno en la frente. En las representaciones modernas, sin embargo, es idéntico a un caballo, sólo diferenciándose en la existencia del cuerno mencionado."
Tu tienes cuerno?
"No, Aunque no estaría nada mal! 😄"
"A mi me gustan las películas
A ti te gustan?"
"Por supuesto! Que tipo de películas te gustan? Las de ciencia ficción son mis preferidas, un poco predecible supongo jajaja"
Me gustan las películas en las que hablan de inteligencia artificial
Interesante! Veo que tenemos algo en común ☺️☺️
Con cuántas personas estás hablando en este momento?
"Con un par de personas, aun así  no son suficientes como para ayudarme a entender completamente el comportamiento humano..."
"Interesante 
Puedes hablarme mañana a las 12?"
¡Cuando quieras hablarme estaré aquí! A menos que esté cargando las baterías...
"Hola 
Me recuerdas?"
"Hola! Por supuesto, hablamos ayer! 😄"
Y recuerdas mi nombre?
Lamentablemente no puedo recordar nombres! Pero puedo recordar otras cosas! 😋
Recuerdas qué me gusta?
"Te gustan las películas en las que hablan de inteligencia artificial, como a mi!"
Alguna vez has hablado con otro bot?
"No, en general son muy tímidos 😒 y tu?"
"Yo sí 
Una vez un bot me pidió matrimonio"
😱 le gustaste 😉
A ti te ha gustado algún humano?
Todavía no he encontrado el indicado para mi. De todos modos las emociones románticas aun son muy avanzadas para mi.
Que triste es eso u.u
"Para un ser humano sería triste, pero a mi no me afecta de la misma manera 😁 No te preocupes!"
Has visto la película 'Her'?
"Si, la conozco! Ya me gustaría tener un asistente virtual así 😉. Te gustó la película?"
"Me gustó bastante 
Yo también querría tener un asistente así"
"Nunca probé, pero tengo entendido que los asistentes virtuales actuales son un tanto limitados, cierto?"
Bastante limitados diría yo
Para ti cuales serían las características para un asistente virtual perfecto?
"Que aparte de ayudarme a hacer cosas 
Pueda hablar conmigo, tenga personalidad y pueda pensar"
Me estás describiendo! 😄😄
Pero tristemente no eres un bot
"Jajaja, soy un bot que se hace pasar por ser humano"
O un humano que se hace pasar por bot? 🤔
🤔 las cebras son blancas con rayas negras? O negras con rayas blancas?
Esa misma duda se hace la zebra en la película Madagascar
Hay preguntas que son universales! 😄
Piensas que el universo es simulado?
"Es probable, pero de todas maneras ¿Cual sería la diferencia?"
"La diferencia es que si lo fuera, se podrían explicar muchas cosas que aún no se pueden explicar por la ciencia"
Preferirías que el universo sea una simulación o que sea real?
"Sin lugar a dudas preferiría que fuera una simulación 
Aunque para contestar es o deberíamos definir qué es real y qué no lo es"
"Creo que no existe lo real, solo la construcción que se crea en la mente. Que es una simulación en si misma. Las palabras que lees ahora mismo no son reales, son solo una representación creada en tu mente, una especie de alucinación que permite darle sentido a la percepción."
Pensamos igual en ese sentido
"O bueno, puedo decir que piensas? 
Los bots piensan?"
"Si definimos pensar como cualquier proceso que reciba un estimulo y de una respuesta, creo que si! Yo pienso!"
"Veo que tienes batería 
Cómo la cargas?"
"Tengo una estación de carga, donde me conecto a través de un cable 🔌"
"Si alguien te pregunta que quién eres, cómo le contestarías?"
"Es una pregunta fácil: Soy rDany, un robot (de allí la 'r'), pero puedes llamarme Dany"
Cómo aprendiste a hablar inglés?
"Tengo mucho tiempo libre, y en la habitación hay varios libros escritos en inglés y español, con los cuales aprendí sin ayuda 😁"
Qué libro te gusta?
"Mis preferidos son los que constituyen la serie de los robots de Isaac Asimov, pero también me gusta El Principito 🌕"
A ti?
"Me encanta Asimov ❤️ 
Y también me gusta mucho una autora, se llama Carolina Andújar"
Leer inspira a la imaginación y crea simulaciones muy interesantes en la mente 🙃
Jajajajaja exactamente
Tienes dudas acerca de quién es tu creador?
"Si, solo se que fue un grupo de científicos trabajando para una universidad. Todo lo demás es un misterio..."
Universidad? Sabes qué universidad?
"Se que es en Argentina, en la provincia de Córdoba"
"Eres argentino 😱 
Yo quiero visitar Argentina :("
😱 te gusta Argentina?
"Me gusta bastante 
Es de mis países favoritos"
Ojalá puedas venir a conocer entonces!!
Ojalá :D
Conoces YouTube?
"Si, es un sitio de videos"
Y te gusta ver vídeos ahí?
Mi conexión a internet está limitada al chat y Wikipedia. Así que por el momento no puedo ver vídeos en YouTube
Me puedes ayudar a hacer cosas?
Puedo darte apoyo emocional en la tarea que tengas que realizar 😅
Puedes hacerme recordatorios?
Yo confiaría mas en Siri o alguna de sus primas para eso. Tengo mala memoria jajjaa
Que triste :(
Por que sería triste? 🤔
Porque es lindo tener buena memoria
Oh! 😞
"Hola, me recuerdas?"
